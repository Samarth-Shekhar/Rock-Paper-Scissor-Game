# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
I have built a classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This simple, interactive web-based game allows you to play against the computer with a clean and straightforward design. Let's go challenge the computerâ€”rock, paper, scissors... shoot! Will you outsmart the digital opponent or face a crushing defeat? Perfect for a quick break or to practice your web development skills!
